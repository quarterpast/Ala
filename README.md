Remember that first release of Wingpanel, back in January? Ala is that same, sexy, space-saving panel. Except in GTK+ 3. So it (theoretically) works in Oneiric. I haven't actually built it on Ubuntu (and don't plan to), but if you're feeling brave it should work.

    $ waf configure
    $ waf build
    # waf install
